2. Click on **`Create Database`**.
3. Provide a name for your database (e.g., "blogs") and click **`Create`**.

### 4. Create Collections

1. Inside your database, click on **`Add Collection`**.
2. Define the collection name (e.g., "`Posts`") and configure its attributes (fields) such as:

   - **`Title`**: String (required)
   - **`Content`**: Text (required)
   - **`Author`**: String (required)
   - **`Created At`**: DateTime (automatically set)

3. Click **`Create`** to finalize the collection.

### 5. Configure Permissions

2. Click on **`Add API Key`**.
3. Provide a name for the key (e.g., "MegaBlog API Key").
4. Select the required scopes based on your project needs (e.g., `database`, `users`, etc.).
5. Click **Create** and copy the generated API key.

### 7. Update Your .env File

Add the following variables to your `.env` file:

```bash
VITE_APPWRITE_URL = "your-appwrite-url"
VITE_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID = "your-project-id"
VITE_APPWRITE_DATABASE_ID = "your-database-id"
VITE_APPWRITE_COLLECTION_ID = "your-collection-id"
VITE_APPWRITE_BUCKET_ID = "your-bucket-id"
```

---

## .env File

This project uses a `.env` file to manage environment-specific variables such as API keys and backend URLs. Before running the project, create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following format:

To access these variables in the project, use:

```js
console.log(import.meta.env.VITE_DB_URL);
```

## .env.sample

The `.env.sample` file is a template or example file that shows developers which environment variables they need to set in their own `.env` file to properly configure the project. It provides placeholders (such as `your-appwrite-api-url`) to indicate what kind of information needs to be entered but without exposing sensitive data like API keys or project IDs.

### Purpose of `.env.sample`:

- **Guidance**: It helps developers set up their environment variables correctly by providing an example structure.
- **Security**: It doesn’t contain actual sensitive data (unlike `.env`), so it can be safely committed to version control.
- **Collaboration**: When working in a team or sharing the project, others can copy this file and rename it to `.env`, then fill in their specific values. This ensures everyone has the same environment variable setup.

---

## Configuring Environment Variables for Production

When deploying your application, it's essential to manage your environment variables effectively to ensure security, flexibility, and maintainability. This section outlines how to create a configuration file for `.env` to use in a production environment.

### Creating the .env File

1. **Create a `.env` file**: In the root of your project, create a new file named `.env`. This file will contain all the environment-specific variables that your application needs to run in production.

2. **Add Environment Variables**: Populate the `.env` file with the necessary variables.

### Accessing Environment Variables Im config.js file

In your Vite application, you can access these environment variables using `import.meta.env.VITE_VARIABLE_NAME` For example:

```js
// ./src/config/config.js
const config = {
  appwriteUrl: String(import.meta.env.VITE_APPWRITE_URL),
  appwriteProjectId: String(import.meta.env.VITE_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID),
  appwriteDatabaseId: String(import.meta.env.VITE_APPWRITE_DATABASE_ID),
  appwriteCollectionId: String(import.meta.env.VITE_APPWRITE_COLLECTION_ID),
  appwriteBucketId: String(import.meta.env.VITE_APPWRITE_BUCKET_ID),
};

export default config;
```

## Authentication Service (Production Grade)

For the authentication flow, we have implemented a robust, production-grade solution using Appwrite. The authentication service handles user registration, login, session management, and logout functionality securely and efficiently. Below is a detailed description of how to set up and use the authentication service in a production environment.

### Step 1: Authentication Service Structure

In this project, the authentication logic is encapsulated within a class `AuthService` for better maintainability and scalability.

### File Structure

Create a dedicated file to manage the authentication logic:

```plaintext
src/
├── appwrite/
│   └── auth_service.js
├── config/
│   └── config.js
```

### Step 2: Configure Appwrite Client in auth_service.js

The authentication service is built using the Appwrite JavaScript. The following code is used to handle account creation, login, session management, and logout.

```js
// src/appwrite/auth_service.js
// visit official documentation for root code
import { config } from "../config/config";
import { Client, Account, ID } from "appwrite";

export class AuthService {
  client = new Client();
  account;

  constructor() {
    this.client
      .setEndpoint(config.appwriteUrl) // Appwrite API URL
      .setProject(config.appwriteProjectId); // Appwrite Project ID

    this.account = new Account(this.client);
  }

  async createAccount({ email, password, name }) {
    try {
      const userAccount = await this.account.create(
        ID.unique(),
        email,
        password,
        name
      );
      if (userAccount) {
        // Automatically log in the user after account creation
        return this.login({ email, password });
      } else {
        return userAccount;
      }
    } catch (error) {
      throw error;
    }
  }

  async login({ email, password }) {
    try {
      return await this.account.createEmailPasswordSession(email, password);
    } catch (error) {
      throw error;
    }
  }

  async getCurrentUser() {
    try {
      return await this.account.get();
    } catch (error) {
      return error;
    }
  }

  async logout() {
    try {
      return await this.account.deleteSessions();
    } catch (error) {
      return error;
    }
  }
}

const authService = new AuthService();
export default authService;
```

### Step 3: Config File for Production

In the config directory, create a `config.js` file to manage environment variables in a centralized way. This helps you easily switch between different environments (development, production) without hardcoding values.

### Step 4: Using the AuthService in Your Components

To use the AuthService in your components, you can import it and call its methods like createAccount, login, getCurrentUser, and logout.

### Benefits of This Approach

1. **Scalability**: By encapsulating authentication logic within a dedicated service (`AuthService`), the app becomes more modular and easier to scale. You can extend or modify authentication methods (e.g., social login) without affecting other parts of the app.

2. **Separation of Concerns**: Managing environment-specific variables (e.g., API URL, Project ID) via the `.env` and `config.js` files keeps sensitive data centralized and ensures that configurations can be easily changed for different environments (development, production).

3. **Reusability**: The `AuthService` class is reusable across components, reducing code duplication and making the app more maintainable.

4. **Security**: Sensitive information like API URLs and keys are securely managed via environment variables, preventing hardcoding of credentials in the codebase.

5. **Error Handling**: The structured use of `try-catch` blocks helps manage errors more effectively, providing better debugging and user experience in the authentication flow.

### Database Service with Appwrite

The `DatabaseService` class provides a centralized approach to managing posts in the Appwrite database. This class handles CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for posts, ensuring all interactions with the Appwrite database are streamlined and reusable.

#### Key Methods in `DatabaseService`

1. **createPost**:

   - Creates a new post in the Appwrite database using the `slug` as the document ID.
   - The post data includes title, content, featured image, status, user ID, and created date.
   - This method is wrapped in a `try-catch` block to handle potential errors during post creation.

2. **updatePost**:

   - Updates an existing post using the `slug` as the document ID.
   - Allows modification of title, content, featured image, status, and creation date.

3. **deletePost**:

   - Deletes a post by its `slug` (document ID).
   - If the operation fails, the method returns `false`, allowing for error handling in the app.

4. **getPost**:

   - Retrieves a single post by its `slug`.
   - This method fetches detailed post information based on the document ID.

5. **getPosts**:
   - Lists all active posts (or other statuses if passed in queries) using custom Appwrite queries.
   - The default query retrieves posts where the status is set to "active", allowing flexibility to modify the query for different conditions.

#### Benefits of Using This Approach

- **Centralized Data Management**: All database interactions are handled in a single service, making it easier to maintain and update the logic in one place.
- **Error Handling**: The `try-catch` structure ensures errors are logged for easier debugging without breaking the application flow.
- **Modularity**: By creating a dedicated `DatabaseService` class, this code promotes reusability across various components of the app.
- **Flexible Queries**: The use of Appwrite’s `Query` system in the `getPosts` method allows for dynamic filtering of posts, improving data retrieval flexibility.

This structured approach ensures that the app's database interactions are efficient, scalable, and easy to maintain.

### Storage Service with Appwrite

The `StorageService` class manages file storage operations within the Appwrite environment. It allows uploading, deleting, and previewing files in a centralized and reusable manner. This service simplifies file management, ensuring that all interactions with the Appwrite storage API are handled consistently.

#### Key Methods in `StorageService`

1. **uploadFile**:

   - Uploads a new file to the Appwrite storage bucket.
   - It uses a unique ID for each file (`ID.unique()`) to ensure no file has a conflicting identifier.
   - This method supports the upload of various file types and sizes.

2. **deleteFile**:

   - Deletes an existing file from the Appwrite storage using the file's unique ID.
   - If successful, the method returns `true`; otherwise, it logs the error and returns `false` for easier error handling.

3. **getFilePreview**:
   - Retrieves a preview of a file stored in the Appwrite storage bucket.
   - This can be particularly useful for displaying images, documents, or other media files without directly downloading them.

This approach ensures smooth file handling operations across the application, providing a seamless experience for managing media and other resources.

# Redux Toolkit Configuration in Large Projects

This guide explains how to configure Redux Toolkit (RTK) in large-scale projects using an `authSlice` as an example.

## 1. Install Dependencies

To get started, install Redux Toolkit and React-Redux:

```bash
npm install @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux
```

## 2. Store Configuration (app/store/store.js)

This file sets up your global store and combines slices.

```js
import { configureStore } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";
import authReducer from "../features/authSlice";

const store = configureStore({
  reducer: {
    auth: authReducer,
  },
});

export default store;
```

## 3. Auth Slice (features/authSlice.js)

This slice handles the authentication state (login/logout) and manages user data.

```js
import { createSlice } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";

const initialState = {
  status: false, // Logged in or not
  userData: null, // User details
};

const authSlice = createSlice({
  name: "auth",
  initialState,
  reducers: {
    login: (state, action) => {
      state.status = true;
      state.userData = action.payload.userData;
    },
    logout: (state) => {
      state.status = false;
      state.userData = null;
    },
  },
});

export const { login, logout } = authSlice.actions;
export default authSlice.reducer;
```

## 4. Using Redux in Components (App.jsx)

Integrate Redux into your components to access the authentication state and dispatch actions.

```jsx
import { useEffect, useState } from "react";
import { useDispatch } from "react-redux";
import { login, logout } from "../features/auth/authSlice";
import authService from "../features/auth/authService";

const App = () => {
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);
  const dispatch = useDispatch();

  useEffect(() => {
    authService
      .getCurrentUser()
      .then((userData) => {
        if (userData) {
          dispatch(login({ userData }));
        } else {
          dispatch(logout());
        }
      })
      .finally(() => setLoading(false));
  }, [dispatch]);

  return loading ? <p>Loading...</p> : <div>Your App Content</div>;
};

export default App;
```

## 5. Connecting Store to the App

In the main index.js or main.jsx file, wrap your app with the Redux Provider.

```jsx
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import { Provider } from "react-redux";
import store from "./app/store";
import App from "./App";

ReactDOM.render(
  <Provider store={store}>
    <App />
  </Provider>,
  document.getElementById("root")
);
```

### This part of documentation explains how to configure Redux Toolkit and provides a structured approach to managing state in large applications.
